Hi, this is Yu Cheng (程羽). I am a second-year graduate student in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University, advised by [Prof. Zhi Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangzhi/#research). I received my B.S. (Summa Cum Laude) from [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm) at Peking University in 2022. 

I am also a research intern in [System Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-and-networking-research-group-asia/) of Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), supervised by [Dr. Jilong Xue](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jxue/) and 
[Dr. Lingxiao Ma](https://xysmlx.github.io/). 

I am also a core developer of [TileLang](https://github.com/tile-ai/tilelang), a programming language for AI workload on various hardware platforms.

My research interests lie in deep learning systems, specifically on compilation optimization of deep learning framework.
